I speak a total of 7 languages, namely: Afrikaans, English, Zulu, Xhosa (this langauge is spoken in the new Black Panther Movie), Tsonga, Tswana and Portugues. I enjoy playing sports, specifically soceer and rubgy. I'm studying Agronomy, Crop and Soil Science - I hope to contribute to feeding the world's growing population.  </p>
