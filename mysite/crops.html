                 <H1>Potato Production.</H1>   
                <p>According to FAOSTAT 2018, Potato production in Africa has more than doubled with 70 percent of that growth concentrated in eastern Africa. Despite these gains, 
                potato yields of small-scale farmers in the region fall short of their potential due to a potent combination of inadequate supplies of high-quality seed and limited awareness of better seed management practices. Potatoes are grown under a wide range of conditions: 
                From irrigated commercial farms in Egypt and South Africa to the tropical highland zones of Eastern and Central Africa, where it is mainly a small farmer’s crop. In some African countries, the production of potatoes is growing rapidly.</p>

                <h1>Corn Production</h1>
                 <p>Maize is the most important cereal crop in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) and an important staple food for more than 1.2 billion people in SSA and Latin America. 
                    More than 300 million Africans depend on maize as the main staple food crop. 
                    All parts of the crop can be used for food and non-food products. Maize accounts for 30−50% of low-income household expenditures in Africa. Over 30% of the caloric intake of people in sub‐Saharan Africa comes from maize. 
                    For these reasons, several African countries that depend on maize as a staple food crop, have adopted agricultural policies to maintain a steady supply of the commodity through increased production and productivity of the crop. Maize is also consumed as a vegetable and it is rich in dietary fiber and other nutrients..</p>

                    <H1>Cassava Production</H1>
                    <p>Cassava, the third main source of carbohydrates in Africa, provides daily nutrition for over 700 million people on the continent and a vital source of income for subsistence farmers. Despite its importance, our knowledge of the heterogeneity of its distribution in the landscape is limited and outdated. 
                        Information on cassava production and harvested area are typically available on aggregated administrative unit level with highly variable temporal range of records, often over a decade old, and represented on a coarse ~10 km by 10 km grid. Here, cassava production and harvested area administrative unit level data for 32 countries are standardised to 2014 FAO reported levels and disaggregated based on the distribution of the rural population in 2014. 
                        The grid obtained represents a significant improvement on the previous studies in terms of both spatial resolution (~1 km by 1 km) and temporal accuracy. Enhanced representation of cassava production and harvested area in Africa is an essential resource for policy making as well as designing strategies to manage its main pathogens..</p>
